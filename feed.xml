Nestled amidst the breathtaking Alps and crystal-clear lake, it welcomed visitors with its charming Swiss architecture. This city, home to around 80,000 residents, seemed to me like an absolute tourist underdog compared to the likes of Zurich, Geneva, or Bern. But oh, it proved me wrong, very wrong. Say Grüezi to Lucerne, the city that defied expectations!</p> <p>On a Friday night, my friend and I debated between going to Mount Rigi or Mount Pilatus, two popular hiking destinations, the next day. Pilatus, with its steeper slopes and rocky terrain, won us over as it seemed more “exciting”. However, before reaching the summit by means of a cable car, we planned to stop by in nearby Lucerne.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/switzerland/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/switzerland/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/switzerland/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/switzerland/2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>We thought of this intermediate step towards Mt. Pilatus as an F1 pit-stop. The plan was to tank our stomachs and quickly stroll around the old town. According to the plan, we parked by Lucerne Lake, just minutes from Lucerne’s city centre where we planned to grab a bite. But the moment we stepped out of the car, our breath stopped. A majestic panorama unfolded before us. Grand, snow-capped mountain range surrounded the city. Below the peaks, sunlight gleamed on the clear lake. It was at that point that we realised, this may as well be the longest pit-stop in the F1 history.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/img/switzerland/9.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/switzerland/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/switzerland/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/switzerland/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/switzerland/3.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>As we strolled along the lakeside path towards the city centre, our jaws remained firmly planted on the ground. The mountains seemed impossibly close, their snowy peaks shimmered in the sunlight. Below, the clear and azure lake hosted occasional sailboats. In the background, sweet classical music filled the air. A medieval-dressed man played the harp by the lake edge. For me, the time stopped at this moment.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/switzerland/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/switzerland/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/switzerland/5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/switzerland/5.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/img/switzerland/4.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <p>As we approached the city, we were greeted by classical Swiss architecture.

I accidentally joined my sister for a run. Her pace was much slower than what I considered mine. I had to refrain myself from running fast. Surprisingly, after the run, I felt energised, joyful, and happy about the experience. Quite a difference from the usual “can’t catch a breath” feeling. The next day, we went for another run. The post run impressions were the same. I realised that perhaps I had never approached running the right way, always pushing it to the max.</p> <p>Soon after, I coincidentally signed up for a 1/4 Ironman event.

Enjoying every single run and continually improving my personal bests across various distances. I’m currently in my top running form, and I’d like to share a few things that made this remarkable transformation possible.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>MADE IT ENJOYABLE:</strong> I mostly run at feel-good pace, and treat sessions as an opportunity to unwind. Before, I would always try to run as fast as possible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>HAD A GOAL:</strong> Signing up for a triathlon has provided extra motivation to build a solid running foundation. I feel like by going for a run I’m making a contribution to a bigger goal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>SCHEDULED RUNS:</strong> I run on set days. Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays (+/- one day depending on special circumstances). I don’t need to think about whether it’s a good time for a run. I just do it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>VARIETY OF TRAININGS:</strong> On Mondays and Wednesdays, I run at feel-good pace, and if I feel up to it, I do random faster intervals. Saturdays are dedicated to slow, long runs. I do them with a friend, thus combining running with socialising and post-run treat in form of coffee and cake combo. It feels like killing two birds with one stone (I love animals).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>GEAR:</strong> I invested in a pair of training shoes. They have good cushioning so I’m not afraid of harming myself. Moreover, it would be a pity if they dusted on a shoe rack.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Special thanks to youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@adrianzycienasportowo"> Życienasportowo</a> which taught me loads about all running related topics.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/running/Polkowice-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/running/Polkowice-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/running/Polkowice-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/running/Polkowice.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Starting line before a memorial run in Polkowice. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/running/PostRunTreat-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/running/PostRunTreat-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/running/PostRunTreat-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/running/PostRunTreat.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Post run treat. </div> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="hobby"/><category term="learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since primary school days, I associated running with breathlessness, extreme exertion, and fatigue.

It was an incredible event with a diverse range of speakers who covered various topics including Java, Cloud, Data, AI, Programming Languages, Architecture, Developer Practices, Culture, and much more. With over 170 talks in total, there was something for everyone. In this blog post, I want to highlight my personal favorite sessions from the conference.</p> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="scaling-from-0-to-20-million-users-by-josip-stuhli">Scaling: from 0 to 20 million users by Josip Stuhli</h4> <hr/> <p>During his captivating presentation, Josip leads the audience on an architectural adventure that begins with a modest setup—a single desktop running Apache Server. However, as demand grew, so did the challenges. Josip skillfully addresses the hurdles he encountered while accommodating an expanding user base and offers actionable strategies to overcome them.
