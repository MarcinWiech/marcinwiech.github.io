I write computer programs and have 3 years of experience in the field. My passion for programming started when I created a computer-guide website for my grandmas, and since then, I've had the privilege of working with some amazing clients and companies, including `KOIOS Master Data`, `J.P Morgan & Chase`, `Flow Traders`.

I specialize in `backend development` mainly `Java`, and I love using my skills and creativity to solve intricate buisness problems. My portfolio showcases some of my most exciting projects and demonstrates my ability to work with different technologies.

When I'm not working on projects, you can find me riding a bike, visiting a casle or with a camera in my hand. If you're interested in working together or just want to say hi, feel free to get in touch!
