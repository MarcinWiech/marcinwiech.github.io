Software Engineer with a passion for solving business problems. 

I've been turning ideas into code commercially since 2018, and my journey began with building a computer guide website for my grandmothers. Since then, I've had the privilege of working for amazing companies such as KOIOS Master Data, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Flow Traders and working on side projects with friends.

My expertise lies in backend development, particularly Java. I thrive on leveraging my skills and creativity to tackle complex business challenges.

Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring on my bike, venturing to historical sites like castles, and capturing moments through photography.
