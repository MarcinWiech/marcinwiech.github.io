Ever since primary school days, I associated running with breathlessness, extreme exertion, and fatigue. It's no surprise, as I participated in almost every school related running competition, busting the guts to be the fastest each time. Although, I loved other sports and tried to develop a similar feeling for running, my numerous efforts always went up in flames. I couldn't understand why.

Everything changed when I expected it the least. I accidentally joined my sister for a run. Her pace was much slower than what I considered mine. I had to refrain myself from running fast. Surprisingly, after the run, I felt energised, joyful, and happy about the experience. Quite a difference from the usual "can't catch a breath" feeling. The next day, we went for another run. The post run impressions were the same. I realised that perhaps I had never approached running the right way, always pushing it to the max.

Soon after, I coincidentally signed up for a 1/4 Ironman event. I was excited about it and got extra motivation to sit down and research a bit about running.

Now, as if by magic, for the last four months, I've run around three times a week. Enjoying every single run and continually improving my personal bests across various distances. I'm currently in my top running form, and I'd like to share a few things that made this remarkable transformation possible.

- **MADE IT ENJOYABLE:** I mostly run at feel-good pace, and treat sessions as an opportunity to unwind. Before, I would always try to run as fast as possible.

- **HAD A GOAL:** Signing up for a triathlon has provided extra motivation to build a solid running foundation. I feel like by going for a run I'm making a contribution to a bigger goal.

- **SCHEDULED RUNS:** I run on set days. Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays (+/- one day depending on special circumstances). I don't need to think about whether it's a good time for a run. I just do it.

- **VARIETY OF TRAININGS:** On Mondays and Wednesdays, I run at feel-good pace, and if I feel up to it, I do random faster intervals. Saturdays are dedicated to slow, long runs. I do them with a friend, thus combining running with socialising and post-run treat in form of coffee and cake combo. It feels like killing two birds with one stone (I love animals).

- **GEAR:** I invested in a pair of training shoes. They have good cushioning so I'm not afraid of harming myself. Moreover, it would be a pity if they dusted on a shoe rack.
