Ever since primary school days, I associated running with breathlessness, extreme exertion, and fatigue. It's no surprise, as I participated in almost every school running competition without any proper training. Although I loved other sports, running never my thing. Even though I attempted numerous running was never enjoyable.

Everything changed when I accidentally joined my sister for a run. Her pace was much slower than what I considered "mine‚Äù. I had to stop myself from running fast. Surprisingly, after the run, I felt energised, joyful, and happy about the experience. The next day, we went for another run, post run impressions were the same. I realised that perhaps I had never approached running in the right way. Always pushing it to the max.

In the meantime, I signed up for a 1/4 Iron Man. This gave me extra motivation to sit down and research a bit about running plans. 

Full disclosure: I'm a newbie, so take my advice with a grain, or handful, of salt.

Now, four months into this journey, I run three times a week and continually improve my personal best across various distances. I'm currently in my best running form, and I'd like to share a few things that made this transformation possible.

* **HAVE A GOAL:** Signing up for a triathlon has provided extra motivation to build a solid running foundation.

* **SCHEDULE RUNS:** I run on set days. Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays (+/- one day depending on special circumstances). I know what to expect, don't need to thing about whether it's a good time for a run. I just do it.

* **VARIETY OF TRAININGS:** On Mondays, I run at a feel-good pace. Wednesdays, I similarly, and if I feel up to it, I do random interval running. Saturdays are dedicated to slow, long runs. I do it with a friend, combining running with socialising and post-run treat in form of coffee and cake combo.

* **GEAR:** I invested in a pair of training shoes (New Balance 880). They have good cushioning so I'm not afraid I'll do myself harm. It would be a pity if let them dust on a shoe rack.

Special thanks to XXX, whose knowledge laid the foundation for the plan outlined above.
